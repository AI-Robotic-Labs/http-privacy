# HTTP Privacy Specification

**Repository**: [AI-Robotic-Labs/http-privacy](https://github.com/AI-Robotic-Labs/http-privacy)  
**Purpose**: Define a standard privacy-enhanced HTTP middleware spec. This allows developers to build their own compliant Rust bindings or clients independently.

---

## 📌 Overview

`http-privacy` is a standard for creating middleware that enhances HTTP privacy. It protects HTTP metadata and payloads using:

- Header filtering
- Payload obfuscation
- IP masking
- TLS enforcement
- Privacy-aware logging

The goal is to let developers implement custom Rust clients/libraries while conforming to the spec.

---

## 📦 Features

### ✅ 1. Header Filtering

- **Modes**: `whitelist` or `blacklist`
- **Use**: Removes or replaces headers like `User-Agent`, `Referer`, `Cookie`, `X-Forwarded-For`.

### ✅ 2. Payload Obfuscation

- **Methods**: `base64`, `xor`, or `aes-gcm`
- **Purpose**: Encode or encrypt payloads to deter inspection.

### ✅ 3. IP Masking

- **Static IP** or randomized
- **Strips/rewrites** client IP from headers (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For`, `CF-Connecting-IP`)

### ✅ 4. TLS Enforcement

- Blocks unencrypted HTTP
- Optional HSTS injection

### ✅ 5. Logging Control

- Levels: `full`, `metadata`, `none`
- Must **redact sensitive** information

## 🛠️ Middleware Processing Flow

### Incoming Request

```

\[Client Request]
→ Filter Headers
→ Obfuscate Payload (optional)
→ Mask IP (optional)
→ Forward to Target Server

```

### Outgoing Response

```

\[Target Server Response]
→ Deobfuscate Payload (if needed)
→ Filter Headers
→ Return to Client

```json
{
  "filter_headers": {
    "mode": "blacklist",
    "headers": ["User-Agent", "Referer", "Cookie"]
  },
  "obfuscation": {
    "enabled": true,
    "method": "base64"
  },
  "ip_masking": {
    "enabled": true,
    "static_ip": "127.0.0.1"
  },
  "tls_enforce": true,
  "logging": "metadata"
}

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Guidelines

* Anyone can implement their own Rust bindings using any async runtime (`tokio`, `async-std`, etc.).
* Middleware must follow the flow and logic defined here.
* Implementations should be **modular and testable**.
* Conformance test kits may be added later.

---

## 🧰 Optional Enhancements

* WASM-compatible bindings
* SOCKS/Tor/Proxy integration
* Privacy budget limiter (rate limit per session/IP)

---

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

* Avoid hardcoded secrets.
* Sanitize inputs and outputs.
* Use TLS certificate pinning when possible.
* Sanitize all logs.

* Developers may submit their Rust crates to the community list in `README.md`
* PRs for test suites or additional features are welcome
* No central SDK: freedom to innovate within spec
